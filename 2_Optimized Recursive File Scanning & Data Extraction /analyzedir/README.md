# analyzeDir - skeleton for Assignment 2

To compile all code, type:
```
$ make
```

To run the resulting code on directory test1:
```
$ ./analyzeDir 5 test1
```

The included `analyzeDir.py` is a correct implementation of the assignment in python. You can use it to see what the outputs should be
for your own implementation. For example:

```
$ ./analyzeDir.py 5 test1
```


## IMPORTANT

Only modify and submit the `analyzeDir.cpp` file. Your TAs will
supply their own versions of the other files (such as main.cpp) to
compile and test your code.
