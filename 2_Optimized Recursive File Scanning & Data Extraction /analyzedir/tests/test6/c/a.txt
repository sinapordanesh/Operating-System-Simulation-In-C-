Many companies are beginning to demand a phone number to verify or activate accounts and to use their applications, luckily with our disposable and virtual service you can avoid providing personal information. We understand that privacy is important and our service allows you to keep your contact information private while gaining access to online SMS activated services from these various companies. We do not retain any message data longer than about a day and use a secure connection to serve our content. Although there are many websites that claim to provide virtual phone numbers, many simply do not work. The majority of services that offer hundreds of numbers copy them from legitimate websites such as ours. This puts your privacy and security at risk as well as wasting your time waiting for a message that may never appear. We always own and maintain our phone numbers ourselves, abiding by our strict privacy policy.
