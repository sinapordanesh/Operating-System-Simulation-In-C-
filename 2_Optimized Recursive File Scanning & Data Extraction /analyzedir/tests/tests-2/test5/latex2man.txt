LATEX2MAN(1)                 Documentation Tools                  LATEX2MAN(1)



[1mNAME[0m
       Latex2man  is a tool to translate UNIX manual pages written with LaTeX-
       into a format understood by  the  UNIX  [4mman[24m(1)-command.   Alternatively
       HTML,  TexInfo,  or LaTeX code can be produced too.  Output of parts of
       the text may be suppressed using  the  conditional  text  feature  (for
       this, LaTeX generation may be used).

[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       latex2man [[1m-t[4m[22mtransfile[24m] [[1m-c[4m[22mCSSfile[24m] [[1m-HMTL[22m] [[1m-h[22m] [[1m-V[22m] [[1m-C[4m[22mname[24m] [[1m-a[4m[22mchar[24m]
       [4minfile[24m [4moutfile[0m

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Latex2man reads the file [4minfile[24m and writes [4moutfile[24m.  The input must  be
       a  LaTeX  document  using the latex2man LaTeXpackage.  Latex2man trans-
       lates that document into the [4mtroff[24m(1) format using the [1m-man [22mmacro pack-
       age.

       Using  the  [1m-H  [22moption, HTML code can be produced, instead of [4mtroff[24m(1).
       With this option you can, optionally, specify a [4mCSSfile[24m as an argument.
       CSS  (Cascading  Style  Sheets) allows you to control the appearance of
       the resulting HTML page.  See below for the names of CSS  classes  that
       are included in the HTML tags as attributes.

       Using the [1m-T [22moption, TexInfo code can be produced, instead of [4mtroff[24m(1).

       Using the [1m-M [22moption, [4mtroff[24m(1) input is produced.

       Using the [1m-L [22moption, LaTeX ouput can be produced, instead of [4mtroff[24m(1).

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-t[4m[22mtransfile[0m
               Translation for user defined LaTeX macros.

       [1m-c[4m[22mCSSfile[0m
               If you use the [1m-H [22myou can also specify a file that contains CSS
              style sheets. The link to the CSS file is inserted into the gen-
              eratedHTML output using the specified [4mCSSfile[24m filename.

       [1m-M[0m
               Produce output suitable for the [4mman[24m(1) command (default).

       [1m-H[0m
               Instead  of  producing  output suitable for the [4mman[24m(1) command,
              HTML code is produced (despite the name of the command).

       [1m-T[0m
               Instead of producing output suitable for  the  [4mman[24m(1)  command,
              TexInfo  code is produced (despite the name of the command). The
              generated .texi-file may be processed with [4mmakeinfo[24m(1) (to  pro-
              duce  an  .info-file)  which  in  turn  may  be  installed using
              [4minstall-info[24m(1).  The Info tags @dircategory and  @direntry  are
              provided.

       [1m-L[0m
               The  LaTeX source is written to the [4moutfile[24m.  This is useful in
              conjunction with the [1m-C[4m[22mname[24m option.

       [1m-C[4m[22mname[0m
               Output the conditional text for [4mname[24m.  If more  than  one  name
              should be given use quotes: [1m-C[4m[22m'name1[24m [4mname2[24m [4m...'[0m
              The following names are defined automatically:

              [1m*      -H [22mdefines HTML

              [1m*      -T [22mdefines TEXI

              [1m*      -M [22mdefines MAN

              [1m*      -L [22mdefines LATEX

       [1m-a[4m[22mchar[0m
               Is used only in conjunction with -T.
              Background:
              TexInfo  ignores all blanks before the first word on a new line.
              In order to produce  some  additional  space  before  that  word
              (using  \SP)  some  character has to be printed before the addi-
              tional space. By default this is a . (dot). The  [4mchar[24m  specifies
              an  alternative  for  that first character. Giving a blank to [1m-a[0m
              supresses the indentation of a line.
              Note: only for the first \SP of a series that [4mchar[24m is printed.

[1mLaTeX COMMANDS[0m
       The LaTeX package  latex2man  is  used  to  write  the  Man-pages  with
       LaTeX.Since  we  translate into other text formats, not all LaTeX stuff
       can be translated.

   [1mPACKAGE OPTIONS[0m
       The latex2man package accepts the following options:

       fancy  use the LaTeX package fancyheadings.

       fancyhdr
              use the LaTeX package fancyhdr.

       nofancy
              neither the LaTeX package fancyheadings nor fancyhdr are used.

       The default option may be specified in the file latex2man.cfg.

   [1mPACKAGE SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTS[0m
       The following environments are provided by the package:

       \begin{Name}{chapter}{name}{author}{info}{title}
              The Name environment takes  five  arguments:  1.   the  Man-page
              chapter,  2.  the name of the Man-page, 3.  the author, 4.  some
              short information about the tool printed in the footline of  the
              Man-page,  and  5.   a text which is used as title, for HTML and
              LaTeX (it's ignored for output of the Man-page or  TeXinfo.  The
              Name  environment must be the first environment in the document.
              Processing starts with this environment. Any text before this is
              ignored (exception: the setVersion and setDate commands). (Note:
              all arguments of \begin{Name} must be written on one line).

       \begin{Table}[width]{columns}
              The Table environment takes two arguments:  the  first  optional
              one  specifies  a width of the last column, the second one gives
              the number of columns.  For example:

       \begin{Table}[2cm]{3}
       Here & am & I \\\hline
       A 1 & A 2 & A 3 1 2 3 4 5 A 3 1 2 3 4 5 \\
       B 1 & B 2 & B 3 \\
       \end{Table}

       will be typeset as:

       Here   am    I
       ----------------------
       A 1    A 2   A 3 1  2
                    3  4 5 A
                    3 1 2  3
                    4 5
       B 1    B 2   B 3

       If  no  optional  [4mwidth[24m argument is given, all entries are typeset left
       justified.  The [4mwidth[24m is a length measured absolutly in [4mcm[24m.  Processing
       with LaTeX a p{width} column is typeset as last column. The translation
       to [4mtroff[24m(1) commands  results  in  a  lw(width)  column  specification.
       Translating to HTML and TexInfo ignores the [4mwidth[24m parameter.

       \hline may be used.

       If  the  Man-page  is  formatted with [4mtroff[24m(1) and tables are used, the
       [4mtbl[24m(1) preprocessor should be called, usually by giving  a  [1m-t  [22mto  the
       call of [4mtroff[24m(1).  When viewing the generated manula page using [4mman[24m(1),
       [4mtbl[24m(1) is called automatically.

       \begin{Description}
              is the same as \begin{description}

       \begin{Description}[label]
              is similar to \begin{description}, but the item labels  have  at
              minimum  the  size of the (optional) word [4mlabel[24m.  The difference
              is visible only in the DVI and PDF-output,  not  in  the  troff,
              TexInfo or HTML output.

              a      |a \begin{description}

              ab     |ab

              abc    |abc

              \ss  =  ?, \"a= ?, \"o= ?, \"u= ?, \"A= ?, \"O= ?, \"U= ?. It is
              allowed to surround these macros in { and } in all places,  even
              inside other macros, e.g.
                   \textbf{\"a\"o\"u\"A\"O\"U\ss}
                   \textbf{\"a}{\"o}{\"u}{\"A}{\"O}{\"U}{\ss}}

       [1m??????? ??????? ???????[0m

       If  these  letters  are  used  in  their LATIN-1 8-bit coding, they are
       translated into the equivalent letter of  the  desired  output  format.
       E.g. ? becomes &Auml; in HTML and @"A in texinfo.

       \input{..}
              Read and process the given filename.

       Please note: the name of the LaTeX-macrosand its arguments must be con-
       tained in one line.

   [1mCONDITIONAL TEXT[0m
       latex2man preprocesses the LaTeX input to allow text to be used  condi-
       tionally. A special sort of LaTeX comment is used for that purpose.

       [1m*      [22m%@% IF [4mcondition[24m %@%

       [1m*      [22m%@% ELSE %@%

       [1m*      [22m%@% END-IF %@%

       A  line must contain only such a comment and nothing else. [4mcondition[24m is
       a boolean expression containing  ``names''  and  operators.  The  names
       given  with  the [1m-C[4m[22mname[24m option have the value ``true'', while all other
       names occuring in the expression are assumed to be  ``false''.  If  the
       evaluation of the boolean expression results in the value ``true'', the
       text in the  ``then''-part  is  used  and  the  text  in  the  optional
       ``else''-part  is  skipped  (and vice versa). The IF/ELSE/END-IF may be
       nested. As boolean operators the following are allowed:

       ( and ) for grouping are allowed.

       For example:
       %@% IF abc %@%
       abc set
       %@%  IF xyz %@%
       xyz set
       %@%  ELSE %@%
       xyz NOT set
       %@%  END-IF %@%
       %@% ELSE %@%
       abc NOT set
       %@%  IF xyz || !XYZ %@%
       xyz OR !XYZ set
       %@%  ELSE %@%
       xyz OR !XYZ NOT set
       %@%  END-IF %@%
       %@% END-IF %@%

       Run this manual page through latex2man with e.g.  [1m-C[4m[22m'abc[24m [4mXYZ'[24m and  have
       a  look to the generated output.  (If simply running the LaTeX-document
       through LaTeX,all lines are shown in the .dvi file).

   [1mTRANSLATION OF USER DEFINED MACROS[0m
       The user macro translation file (given by the  [[1m-t[4m[22mtransfile[24m])  contains
       Perl commands specifying the translation of LaTeX macros defined by the
       user. These macros may have none, one or two arguments.  The  following
       code is expected:

       [1m*      [22mComments start with a # up to the end of the line.

       [1m*      [22mFor  a  macro \foo with no arguments, the following code must be
              specified:

              Translation to Man-Pages
                     $manMacro{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to HTML
                     $htmlMacro{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to TexInfo
                     $texiMacro{'foo'} = '...';

              where ... is the translation.

       [1m*      [22mFor a macro \foo{..} with one argument, the following code  must
              be specified:

              Translation to Man-Pages
                     $manMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $manMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to HTML
                     $htmlMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $htmlMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to TexInfo
                     $texiMacro1a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $texiMacro1b{'foo'} = '...';

              where  ...  is  the  translation. The 1a code is used before the
              argument, while 1b is typeset after the argument is set.

       [1m*      [22mFor a macro \foo{..}{..} with two arguments, the following  code
              must be specified:

              Translation to Man-Pages
                     $manMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $manMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
                     $manMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to HTML
                     $htmlMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $htmlMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
                     $htmlMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

              Translation to TexInfo
                     $texiMacro2a{'foo'} = '...';
                     $texiMacro2b{'foo'} = '...';
                     $texiMacro2c{'foo'} = '...';

              where  ...  is  the  translation. The 2a code is used before the
              first argument, 2b between the two arguments and 2c  is  typeset
              after the second argument is set.

       [1m*      [22mThe file latex2man.trans contains some example code.

       This is another \subsubsection.

   [1mGENERAL REMARKS[0m
       1.     Empty lines are typeset as paragraph separators.

       2.     The  arguments of the LaTeX commands must not be split over sev-
              eral lines.

       3.     Do not nest calls to macros.

       4.     Except the mentioned environment and macros, the usage of  other
              LaTeX  environments  or  macros  are not translated. Their usage
              will cause garbage in the output.

       5.     latex2man requires Perl version >= 5.0004_03.

       6.     If you want to install the system with the distributed Makefile,
              you need GNU-make.  If you don't have it, you should execute the
              steps shown in the Makefile manually.

[1mCSS CLASSNAMES[0m
       The table below shows the names of CSS classes that will be included in
       the  HTML tags as attributes.  You can specify the CSS style properties
