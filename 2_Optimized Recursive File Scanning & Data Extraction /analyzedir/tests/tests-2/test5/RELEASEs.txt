FIRST UPLOAD was v0.6 as of 2012-10-14.

UPLOAD of v0.7 as of 2012-10-17 (2012-10-18):

 * New option -c adds test of "date consistency" with the 
   `filedate' package and may thus be a way to check 
   "date consistency" with XeLaTeX (where \pdffilemoddate 
   is not available ... may be silly ...).
 * Indeed new option -x uses `xelatex' rather than `latex' 
   (see manual `adhocfilelist.htm' for discussion of 
    possible silliness -- somewhat missing in `filedate' 
    discussion).
 * Some documentation mistakes have been corrected.
 * srcfiles.tex checks date consistency for scripts and 
   documentation and lists what is used indeed 
   (but cf. makehtml.log from recent makehtml.tex).
 * `adhocfilelist.RLS' provides a release summary with 
   `typeoutfileinfo', appearing in SrcFILEs.txt too.
    
v0.8 should allow -c with an explicit list of filenames ...

UPLOAD r0.3 (2012-10-19):

 * added present RELEASE.txt (started for v0.7)
 * corrected adhocfilelist.tds.zip
 * added `filedate' checks in makehtml.tex, additionally 
   to those in srcfiles.tex
 * \listfiles in makehtml.tex (HTML driver) more careful, 
   using `nicefilelist', for comparison with SrcFILEs.txt

UPLOAD r0.4 (2012-11-20):

 * deprecated -follow replaced by -L
 * `adhocfilelist.RLS' provides a release summary with 
   `typeoutfileinfo', appearing in SrcFILEs.txt too.
   [was announced earlier, but not carried out 
    -- may worry Karl]
 * using `fdatechk.tex'
 * TDS: texmf/source/support/adhocfilelist, cf. `texdef'
 
UPLOAD r0.4a (2012-11-22):

 * exemplifies \ReadShInfos from `readprov.sty' v0.5 
   in `makehtml.tex' and `srcfiles.tex'
 * no change in shell script files

UPLOAD r0.4c (2013-01-04):

 * regenerated documentation with `morehype' r.81
