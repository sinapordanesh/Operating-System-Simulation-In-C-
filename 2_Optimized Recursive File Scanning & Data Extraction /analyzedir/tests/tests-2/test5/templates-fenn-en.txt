templates-fenn
--------------

This package contains a series of templates I had previously published
on my personal website. I had already published the template for
scrlttr2 earlier at http://www.komascript.de/ . I had written these
templates for my personal use only, that's why they are all in
German. It should, however, be easy to adapt them to other
languages. Jan Beilicke has provided an English version of my scrlttr2
letter template. If you need help for this, please send me an
email. You can reach me at http://www.juergenfenn.de/ .

Please don't hesitate to upload your own templates to CTAN. The more
files we gather together here, the better for (La)TeX users seeking
help and advice on how to use (La)TeX properly and efficiently.

The package contains these commented templates:

scrlttr2.tex: a letter to be written with scrlttr2.cls from the
  KOMA-Script bundle by Markus Kohm.

scrlttr2en.tex: English translation of scrlttr2.tex by Jan Beilicke.

dinbrief.tex: a letter according to the German DIN standards to be
  written with dinbrief.cls.

kbrief.tex: a brief memo ("Kurzbrief") to accompany enclosures, as
  used in German offices, based on dinbrief.

vermerk.tex: a general form for taking down notes on events in the
  office.

diabetes.tex: a diary for the basis-bolus insulin therapy of diabetes
  mellitus, based on scrartcl.

templates-fenn-en.txt: This file you are about to read, giving an
  overview of the package in English.

templates-fenn-de.txt: The German version of this file.
