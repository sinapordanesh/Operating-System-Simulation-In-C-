This document contains instructions on how to use MLTeX's \charsubdef
extension with LaTeX.  Before reading this file, you should read
`install.txt', which will explain how the LaTeX installation works.

CREATING THE LaTeX FORMAT
=========================

To create the LaTeX format, you should follow the standard LaTeX
installation guide.

 - Do NOT include any MLTeX specific file into your LaTeX format!

 - Do NOT use the obsolete files `compatible.tex', `extdef.tex',
   `masthyph.tex', or any other file from the old MLTeX distribution!

 - Depending on your TeX implementation there is either a special
   version of the `initex' program provided which is called `mlinitex',
   `initex -mltex', or `tex -ini -mltex'.
   Use this program resp. command line options when creating the LaTeX
   format.

As a result your LaTeX format file `latex.fmt' should not contain any
MLTeX specific definitions or declarations.



USING THE MLTeX EXTENSION
=========================

To enable the MLTeX extension, you simply use the standard LaTeX
package `fontenc' with the MLTeX font encoding LO1 instead of OT1,
e.g. replace

   \usepackage[T1,OT1]{fontenc}

by

   \usepackage[T1,LO1]{fontenc}

which will choose LO1 as the default font encoding.  If you want to
choose another default font encoding, you can switch to LO1 by

   \fontencoding{LO1}\selectfont

within your document.  Nonetheless you have to declare the new font
encoding `LO1' by loading it using the package `fontenc'.

For LaTeX's font encoding OT1 the associated MLTeX font encoding is
provided with a basic set of fd files.  This font encoding is called
LO1 (for M_L_TeX's _O_T1) and is a superset of OT1.


Another simpler way to use this MLTeX extended font encoding is
provided by the package `mltex'.  By including

   \usepackage{mltex}

in the document preamble all references to OT1 will get replaced by
LO1.  If you don't want to hide OT1 totally, you can select LO1 as
usual default font encoding by using the package option `switchonly',
e.g. by including

   \usepackage[switchonly]{mltex}

in the document preamble.
