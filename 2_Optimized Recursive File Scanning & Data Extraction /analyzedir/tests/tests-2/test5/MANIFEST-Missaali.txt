If you create derived work from this work, please rename the files
that contain the word 'missaali' in their filenames. 

The Condition 3 of the Latex Project Public License allows you to
distribute a Compiled Work version of this work. Such a version should
contain the files Missaali-Regular.otf, missaali.pdf, and optionally
missaali.sty if the distribution is intended to be used with the
XeLaTeX system. Strictly speaking only Missaali-Regular.otf is
absolutely necessary but the font is complex and non-standard enough
that without the user's manual it is difficult to get all use out of
it. Including the license files is a good idea, too.
